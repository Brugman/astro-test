# Astro test

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
    â””â”€â”€ styles/
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any re-usable HTML/Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Layouts, found in `src/layouts/`, build up the site, and take the content from pages and put them into HTML, or components, via attributes and slots.

Global styles can be found in `src/styles/global.less`, and imports from there.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

On build the static output gets sent to the `dist/` directory, for distribution.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
